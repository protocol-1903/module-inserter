This mod allows inserters to interact with the module slots of normally inaccessible entities. Notably, crafting machines and labs. This allows you to change your setups on a whim, or when used in combination with certain other mods, allows for new pathways for production...
Please report any bugs here or on [github](https://github.com/protocol-1903/module-inserter)

If you have a mod idea, let me know and I can look into it.
